## [CA1 - Dataframe manipulations and raw data visualisations](https://github.com/aadle/DAT200-anvendt-ML/blob/main/CA1/CA1.ipynb)

## [CA2 - Training Perceptron and Adaline classifiers on wine data](https://github.com/aadle/DAT200-anvendt-ML/blob/main/CA2/CA02_exercise.ipynb)

## [CA3 - Prediction of water quality for human consumption](https://github.com/aadle/DAT200-anvendt-ML/blob/main/CA3/CA3%20-%20Aaron.ipynb)
- You are a data scientist employed by a local water treatment company to help them predict if water is safe for human consumption. The dataset given to you consists of different sensor readings such as pH, turbidity, and more. Your employer warns you about the possibility of outliers in the dataset due to an unexperienced intern being responsible for parts of the data collection


## [CA4 - Prediction of liver cirrosis](https://github.com/aadle/DAT200-anvendt-ML/blob/main/CA4/CA4%20-%20Aaron.ipynb)
- A hospital has hired you to develop a machine learning model to predict the stage of liver cirrhosis in their patients. Cirrhosis is a late stage of scarring (fibrosis) of the liver caused by many forms of liver diseases and conditions, such as hepatitis and chronic alcoholism. The patient data consist of a mix of continuous and categorical features. As so often with clinical data, it contains also some missing values, because some features have not been measured or registered for some patients. 

## [CA5 - Chili hotness prediction on Scoville scale](https://github.com/aadle/DAT200-anvendt-ML/blob/main/CA5/CA5%20-%20Aaron.ipynb)
- A large-scale grocery retailer imports chili from all over the world. The imported chilies have different levels of hotness and need to be distributed to different customers across the country. In order to further automate the distribution process to the customers a machine learning model is needed that can predict the hotness of each chili in a rapid manner based on a number of measurements done on the chili without involving human tasting.  
The large-scale grocery retailer measures a number of properties of the chili (see data description) which also requires resources. Can the model be trained on fewer features and provide good performance to save further resources and stop doing unnecessary measurements?
